Plugin Overview

This plugin enhances the submission workflow by introducing a mandatory author-count selection in the submission form. Authors are required to specify the total number of authors, and the system enforces the completion of author metadata to match the declared number. This ensures completeness, accuracy, and consistency of authorship information at the point of submission.

The plugin is particularly useful for journals that require strict control over authorship data and wish to prevent incomplete or inconsistent author listings.
